      "premium.v2.qa4.question": "What Premium tools are good for low-carb or Keto diets?",
      "premium.v2.qa4.answer1": "Premium is perfect for low-carb lifestyles for a couple of reasons. People on low-carb and Keto plans often like to track “net carbs” instead of “total carbs” so Premium includes an optional setting called Net Carbs Mode which only tracks the carbs that add calories. This means that the carbs from fiber and sugar alcohols are subtracted automatically. Many people find that not having their fiber intake impact their carb goal helps them stay on track for their fiber goal, too.",
      "premium.v2.qa4.answer2": "And if you’re new to low-carb, try our Low Carb Meal Plan, included with Premium. Enjoy daily tips, recipes, and resources from our registered dietitian as you ease into low-carb eating. We also have an entire collection of low-carb recipes you can log with one tap as a Premium member.",

        "premium.v2.qa4.question": "What Premium tools are good for low-carb or Keto diets?",
        "premium.v2.qa4.answer1": "Premium is perfect for low-carb lifestyles for a couple of reasons. People on low-carb and Keto plans often like to track “net carbs” instead of “total carbs” so Premium includes an optional setting called Net Carbs Mode which only tracks the carbs that add calories. This means that the carbs from fiber and sugar alcohols are subtracted automatically. Many people find that not having their fiber intake impact their carb goal helps them stay on track for their fiber goal, too.",
        "premium.v2.qa4.answer2": "And if you’re new to low-carb, try our Low Carb Meal Plan, included with Premium. Enjoy daily tips, recipes, and resources from our registered dietitian as you ease into low-carb eating. We also have an entire collection of low-carb recipes you can log with one tap as a Premium member.",
